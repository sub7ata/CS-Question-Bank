# CS-Question-Bank
It's my BCA 6th semester project created on Visual Studio 2010.


<p align="justify">
The CS Question Bank project is made particularly for the staff of Universities or Colleges who would control the administrative job of the project as this would help them to prepare question papers for different subjects of Computer Science & Application. The staff would upload previous year questions by year and by different subjects. Also single questions can be inserted subject and topic wise as well.<br />
The uploaded questions would be freely available to all the common users. The users can download previous year questions as pdf format and also they can search questions using certain keywords and view questions with its respective subject along with different topics.<br />
There is a suggestion part for users where they can suggest different types of subject wise new questions by uploading them directly. But those questions will only be available after the authentication of administrator.</p>
